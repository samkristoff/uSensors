This is the uSensor Bootloader.  This folder contains code to flash uSensor devices with the USB bootloader using a programmer such as the PICKIT3.  Once a uSensor is programmed with the bootloader the sensor firmware can be updated via USB.  This allows users to update their firmware without special hardware.
